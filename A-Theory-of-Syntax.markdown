#A Theory of Syntax

It has come to my concern that a regard for the syntax of Psychonautics has 
been wanting in terms of a vivid explication and elucidation, with the support 
of an Algebraic Calculus for Transformations toward the determination of 
terminal objects within the ontologies of various Psychonatics Experts, or who 
might be called Mystics.

The Mystics of Psychonautics can be formulated as MBTI entities along to 
Platonic or Macedonian Warriors culminated through the rigors of Early 
Writing, and Historical Method. Modern demarcations of Definition are just as 
susceptible to arbitrary exclusion from internally consistent sets as are 
Ancient Demarcations; we might say that Language itself fails to attain truth 
functionality, that it might disable the construction of N Worlds at any 
arbitrarily normalized quantized measurement. The Mind, as it were, becomes a 
Mython within an arrangement of Qubital normalization, elucidated through the 
Democritaen Interpretation of Quantum Field Theory, which defines a framework 
of space as an infinite lattice: The Mind is everywhere the Material is not.
